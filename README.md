- 👋 Hi, I’m @AngeTKL
- 👀 I’m passionate about genetic epidemiology, particularly exploring genetic factors that influence cardiovascular diseases, stroke, atrial fibrillation (AF), and carotid plaques.
- 🌱  Currently learning: I’m diving into Mendelian Randomization (MR), drug target-MR, and Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS).
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate: I’m always open to collaboration on genetic epidemiology projects, especially focused on cardiovascular diseases.
- 📫 How to reach me by email tchosange@yahoo.fr
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- I share some bioinformatics codes that I use for genetic data analysis—feel free to explore, reach me and collaborate!
With a background in medicine, I’m deeply passionate about bioinformatics and pathway analysis. I am particularly keen to work on African genetic data to explore health disparities and improve medical insights.

⚡ Fun fact: I love dancing! 💃 And I am passionate about global politics, women empowerment, and advocate for more women in science in Africa.
